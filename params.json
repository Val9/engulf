This only runs in google chrome at the moment\r\n1. Download the jar from the [downloads page](https://github.com/andrewvc/engulf/downloads)\r\n1. Run it like so `PORT=4000 java -jar engulf-VERSION.jar`\r\n1. Visit http://localhost:4000 in your browser to use the GUI\r\n\r\n# Todo:\r\n\r\n* RESTful interface (partially complete)\r\n* Distributed workers (in progress, on 'net' branch)\r\n\r\n## Hacking\r\n\r\nEngulf is a work in progresss. The *currently released version is the 2.x branch.*\r\nMaster represents the upcoming 3.0 version, which will feature distributed operation,\r\n saved results, a REST API, and numerous other improvements. It's currently only 70% done\r\nand barely runnable (with no UI). If you're interested in helping out, just ping me!\r\n\r\n## Legacy\r\n\r\nThere is a legacy version of engulf available on the downloads page and the `legacy` branch that runs quite differently.\r\n\r\n## Thanks!\r\nI'd like to thank YourKit for providing this project with their Java profiler (which works excellently with Clojure).\r\nIt's great at spotting performance issues.
