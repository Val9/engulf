{"body":"# engulf\r\n\r\nengulf is a distributed HTTP load tester written in Clojure and Javascript. It's designed to let you spin up a cluster of high performance HTTP load-testers without requiring any extra infrastructure. Just put the JAR on your servers and point them at a master with the proper shell command. engulf can also be run in a standalone configuration on your workstation with just as little effort.\r\n\r\nSome of engulf's features:\r\n\r\n* An [HTTP API](https://github.com/andrewvc/engulf/wiki/HTTP-API)\r\n* [Simple Usage](https://github.com/andrewvc/engulf/wiki/Usage)\r\n* Markov URL Request Pattern Generation\r\n* Annotation and Recording of all results in SQLite (retrievable via REST as well)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://img.skitch.com/20120811-qf81tgw9pg51mnbjnidq4axmgf.png)\r\n\r\n## Get up and running\r\n\r\n1. This only runs in google chrome at the moment\r\n1. Download the jar from the [downloads page](https://github.com/andrewvc/engulf/downloads)\r\n1. Run it like so `PORT=4000 java -jar engulf-VERSION.jar`\r\n1. Visit http://localhost:4000 in your browser to use the GUI\r\n1. See the wiki page on [usage](https://github.com/andrewvc/engulf/wiki/Usage) for more details.\r\n\r\n# Todo:\r\n\r\n* Embedded JS Engine\r\n* Browsing past jobs in the UI\r\n* Targetting subsets of nodes\r\n\r\n## Hacking\r\n\r\nEngulf is a work in progresss. The 3.0.0 branch is currently alpha quality but is rapidly approaching beta.\r\n\r\n## Thanks!\r\nI'd like to thank YourKit for providing this project with their Java profiler (which works excellently with Clojure).\r\nIt's great at spotting performance issues.
